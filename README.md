# What is w3m? #

w3m is a text-based web browser as well as a pager like `more' or `less'. With w3m you can browse web pages through a terminal emulator window (xterm, rxvt or something like that). Moreover, w3m can be used as a text formatting tool which typesets HTML into plain text.

# This git repository #

This git repo was imported from CVS (-d:pserver:anonymous@w3m.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/w3m) via git-cvsimport.

I'll try my best to keep it up-to-date. The origin branch tracks CVS.
